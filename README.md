Global Earthquake Data Visualization Project
This Python-based project retrieves real-time earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake API, processes key details, and visualizes the results on an interactive world map. Using Folium, the map plots earthquake occurrences with color-coded markers based on magnitude, enhancing seismic data analysis. The project leverages Pandas for data processing and Matplotlib for visualization, providing insights into earthquake frequency and severity globally.
